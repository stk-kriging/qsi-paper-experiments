% Demonstration using the modified branin-hoo function
%
% Plots show:
% - Density of the stochastic/uncertain inputs.
% - Initial design (black dots), sampled points (red dots), contour and estimated contour of the
%   points belonging to the critical region (black and red curves).
% - True and estimated quantile sets.
%
% May take a while due to graph generation
